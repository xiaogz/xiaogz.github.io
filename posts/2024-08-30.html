            <p>I have been talking about starting a blog to jot down my learnings a decade ago but am finally doing it. For context, I am working as a programmer since 2019. My experiences come from dealing with operating systems and distributed backends. I currently use Neovim as my main IDE and can use Visual Studio if I have to. I have very little frontend experience. Part of my reluctance in dabbling in frontend is the overwhelming amount of frameworks that everyone tries to push to newcomers and the complexity in managing node packages and web builds. Weeks before I tried to learn eleventy and tailwind css but when I was looking up information on how to use them together to serve sites, many blogs assume you can deal with another tool or are willing to invest more time to learn it like webpack, gulp, postcss, etc. I just wanted to write down my learnings and don't care much about how my site is styled or built.<br></p>
            <p>After realizing I am getting further and further away from my main goal of writing and getting more and more into the weeds of frontend development, I said enough is enough and deleted all the node packages. I then asked chatgpt for a static blog site and just copy-pasted it and then edited placeholder strings. This combined with GitHub Pages that can serve static sites from a branch is all that I needed. <br></p>
            <p>Many others have said this but I can now claim with my starter site experience as well: chatgpt is great as a starting point when you are dabbling into an unknown task. For example, I didn't know that you can locally serve your static site via "python -m http.server". This avoids needing to install node.<br></p>
            <p>I might eventually bring myself to try out tailwind css again for easy dark mode styling. For now, I'm considering this mission accomplished!<br></p>
